The for loop initialization statement
The initialization statement is executed only once, before the first loop iteration. Usually, it’s used to initialize (or declare and initialize) a variable that will be used as a loop counter. We can use any existing variable as a counter, but in general it’s good practice to declare a new one, as this makes the code cleaner and easier to read and understand.
The initialization statement is optional and can be left empty, except for ending with a semicolon.


A condition statement is an expression that is evaluated to a Boolean before each loop iteration.
The for loop increment statement : 
and most of the time it’s used to increment (or decrement, depending on the need) a loop counter that is used in a condition statement.
It can be any expression, not only incrementation/decrementation.

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
