Operators can be categorized in several ways binary (+,-) or unary (typeof) , ternary 
or prefix operators (occurring before the operand), postfix operators (after the operand) and infix operators (between operands).
assignment; arithmetic; logical; or conditional operators.
The same symbol can be interpreted as a different operator depending on the context (exemple + contacte on string or calculate on numbers)
If several assignment operators appear in a sequence, the order from right to left applies. So the sequence:
let year = 2050;
let newYear = year = 2051;
