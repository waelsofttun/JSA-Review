*****************Objects – What is an object?**********************

Note that typeof returns the name of the data type as a string.
arrays in JavaScript are also objects. In JavaScript, even functions are objects. In fact, everything in JavaScript, except a primitive, is an object.
----An object as a different type of array-------
A key is simply a label (a name), which is unique within an object and unambiguously defines the selected element.
In objects, we call their component elements properties. Each property will consist of a key (or label) and a value.
As we’ll see later in the course, JavaScript allows you to create objects in many different ways. The easiest way is to use curly brackets.
literal notation == initializer notation 
let sampleObject = {
    id: 10, 
    delay: 20,
    name: "en to tre",
    isPresent: true,
    delay: 50
};

We can modify an object created in this way by, among other things, adding new properties.(dot notation)
sampleObject.newkey= value

The key is a string. When creating an object, the key can be enclosed in quotation marks, although this is not necessary 
(JavaScript automatically interprets it as a string). However,this can be useful when you want to create a key consisting of several words. For example, 
the following construction will be wrong:
//error
let contact = {
	first name: "Ronald"
};
//correct
let contact = {
    "first name": "Ronald"
};

However, giving keys names consisting of many separate words is not the best idea.

If you need a multi-word name, it’s better to use, for example, the Camel case notation, and write firstName instead of "first name". 
The notation will be both more readable to the user and less burdensome on the computer. With multi-word keys, 
it will also be a problem to refer to the property of an existing object – dot notation does not allow it.
bracket notation is the solution for this
the object property does not have to be of the number, Boolean, or string type. It could as easily be an array, an object, or a ... function. 
*************Deleting objects************
The JavaScript engine uses a Garbage Collector, which decides for us whether the objects are still needed, and possibly removes them.

The JavaScript language doesn’t even provide for the possibility of explicitly deleting objects.

**************Properties*********************
---------Types : 
As we mentioned earlier, we can assign primitive values to variables (e.g. number, Boolean, or string), complex values such as arrays or objects, and functions.
let test = {
nr: 10, 
b: false, 
str: "uno dos tres", 
arr: [10, 20, 30], 
obj: {
x: 10, 
y: 20
}, 
fn: function(arg) {console.log(arg)} 
};

test.fn(123);

----------Nested properties : 
If the property of an object is another object that has properties itself, then we are dealing with nested properties.
Referring to such fields using dot notation is intuitive, and we simply add another dot and key (property name).
console.log(test.obj.x);
test.obj.y = 40;
-----------A function as a property type – a method
A function that is the property of an object will be called a method.
Just as the properties of objects describe their characteristics, methods can be treated as their characteristic behavior, or ways of changing the state of an object.
