This requires some additional explanation, because the original class syntax introduced into JavaScript in ECMAScript 6 does not offer the possibility to explicitly declare properties inside the class body.
Weâ€™ll discuss two methods of declaring a property: in the body of the constructor and methods, and an alternative, the new one, in the body of the class.

Property definitions inside class methods : 
When introducing classes into the JavaScript language, it was assumed that properties would be defined according to the needs inside the bodies of the constructor and methods.
To be honest, it is not really a true declaration. We take advantage of the fact that if we try to store the value in a non-existent property, it will be created automatically.
vehicle1.x=3;
console.log(vehicle1.x)
