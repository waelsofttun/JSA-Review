Naming the variables : 

In JavaScript, variable names may consist of any sequence of letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits, underscore characters, and dollar signs, 
but they must not start with a digit. There is a list of reserved words that cannot be used as variable names (look at the table below).

JavaScript interpreter distinguishes between lower-case and upper-case letters, also in variable names, so names such as test, Test, or TEST will be treated as different.


For the declarations, we use the keywords var or let for variables and const for constants

var vs let
The keyword var comes from the original JavaScript syntax, and the keyword let was introduced much later. 
Therefore, you will find var more in older programs. Currently, it is highly recommended to use the word let for reasons .

One of the basic differences in the use of var and let is that let prevents us from declaring another variable with the same name (an error is generated).
no matter if let or var is used in the previous declaration. 
Using var allows you to re-declare a variable, which can potentially lead to errors in the program execution.


when you don't make declaration and use ( x= 5 ) it is okay for javascript but it can make problems for the scope 

strict Mode :

"use strict"; // force the interpreter to behave according to modern JavaScript standards
height = 180; // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: height is not defined
console.log(height);

 JavaScript will not control what type of value we store in the variable

JavaScript allows us to easily replace the greeting variable with a value whose type is different from the one originally stored there.
JavaScript goes one step further and not only allows us to change the types of values kept in a variable, but it also performs their implicit conversion if necessary .
counter = 100 ;
greeting = "Hello!";
greeting = greeting + counter;
console.log(greeting); // -> Hello!100

Constants : 
const greeting = "Hello!";

const greeting; // -> Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
greeting = "Hello!";

const greeting = "Hello!";
greeting = "Hi!"; // -> Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
