Single-line comments 
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 42; // This is also a single line comment, although the part before the double slash is proper code and will be executed
// This line and the next one will be ignored
// x = 8;
console.log(x); // -> 42
Multi-line comments :
/*
    This is a block
    comment and it can
    span multiple lines

    So this code won't be executed
    console.log("Hello, World!");
*/

let x /* because no better name */ = 42;
console.log(x);

There are tools that can automatically generate documentation from comments, as long as they are used according to the tools reference. An example of such a tool could be JSDoc. Placing comments in the code according to the format of this tool will make it possible to 
generate a website containing detailed information about a project (e.g. descriptions of functions, their call parameters, returned values etc.).
